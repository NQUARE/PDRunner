# PDRunner
#### A simple 'runner' game made in C ++ using ncurses for windows, pdcurses.
#### I made it very fast and optimized. It is based on bit operations, the entire map is stored in a single perm of type int and the map is shifted by bit shifting, so it is very fast!
## Thank me for my work=)
